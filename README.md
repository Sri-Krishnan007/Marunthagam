# 🌟 Marunthagam - The Medicine Chatbot 💊🤖

# 🚀 Project Overview

Marunthagam is an intelligent, AI-powered chatbot that acts as a virtual healthcare assistant, capable of answering medical queries, diagnosing symptoms, recommending treatments, and suggesting nearby doctors. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the chatbot helps make healthcare more accessible, especially in rural areas. 🌍💡

# 🩺 Key Features

💬 Medical Query Processing: Understands and processes user queries efficiently.
🧠 Symptom Diagnosis: Predicts potential diseases based on symptoms.
💊 Treatment Suggestions: Recommends medications and treatments.
🔴🟡🟢 Symptom Severity Detection: Classifies symptoms as normal, high, or very high, and provides doctor recommendations based on location.
📝 User Feedback Mechanism: Continuously improves through user feedback.
🗣 Voice and Text Support: Accessible via both text and voice input for a seamless user experience.
⚙ Technology Stack
💻 Languages & Libraries
Python 3.12.7 🐍: Core programming language.

# ML Libraries:

scikit-learn for various machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression, GBM).
NumPy & Pandas for data processing.
SpaCy for NLP tasks (tokenization, lemmatization, etc.).
Frontend: Streamlit for building the user interface.

# ☁ Deployment
